                    I'm sure most software developers are asked the same question everyday by new people they meet.
                </p>
                <p>
                    What is it you actually do?
                </p>
                <p>
                    This is a question I've had to answer numerous times and each time I think I've given a different
                    answer. I’ll try to explain it in the most non-technical perspective way possible. I hope this
                    helps.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Think of a software developer as a type of builder on a construction site.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Instead of building a house, we are building a program.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Instead of using tools such as hammers and nails, we use keyboards and monitors.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Does this make it clearer? We are inventors, designers, innovaters and creators all in one.
                </p>

                    Like all houses nothing is perfect, much like programs. These “Problems” in programs are known
                    as
                    bugs.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Like all houses they need to be designed from the outside and inside, in a program the design is
                    the
                    UI or User Interface of the program. This is essentially how the program looks to a user.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Like all houses they need to be planned from the very start by an architect, this is similar to
                    programs, they also need to be planned weeks before anything is coded.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Long story short think of a program as building a house. A lot of thought is needed, it can be
                    done
                    in so many different ways, it could take weeks even months to build depending on size. There
                    will
                    always be problems and it will never be perfect.
                </p>

                    You might even call us:

                <p>
                    Virtual Architects
                </p>
                <p>
                    if it helps to remember what we do.
                </p>

                    P.S. We don’t spend endless hours on Facebook and Twitter!
